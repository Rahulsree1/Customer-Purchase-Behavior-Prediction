# Customer Purchase Behavior Prediction
## Overview
This project implements a predictive analytics model to forecast customer purchase behavior using a Naive Bayes classifier and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By applying advanced machine learning techniques for data analysis and dimensionality reduction, the model enhances predictive accuracy and supports better decision-making capabilities.

## Features
- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** Utilized for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification problems.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Applied for dimensionality reduction, helping to improve model performance and interpretability.
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib is used for visualizing the data and results, making it easier to understand the patterns and insights.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Pandas is employed for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.
